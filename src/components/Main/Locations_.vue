                    <h3>HA NOI</h3>
                    <p>Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, is known for its centuries-old architecture and a rich
                        culture with Southeast Asian, Chinese and French influences. At its heart is the
                        chaotic Old Quarter, where the narrow streets are roughly arranged by trade. </p>

                    <h3>HA LONG</h3>
                    <p>Hạ Long, a city on Vietnam’s northern coast, is a jumping-off point for Hạ Long Bay,
                        a broad inlet of dramatic, often mist-covered limestone islands. Replicas of
                        traditional junk boats tour the bay and depart from the city’s Bai Chay district.

                    <p>Da Nang is a coastal city in central Vietnam known for its sandy beaches and history
                        as a French colonial port. It's a popular base for visiting the inland Bà Nà hills
                        to the west of the city. Here the hillside Hải Vân Pass has views of Da Nang Bay and
                        the Marble Mountains.</p>
